## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Oct 6, 2025** - Using `~bootstrap/scss/` instead of `@bootstrap/` alias (sass-loader handles tilde)
2. **Oct 6, 2025** - Not importing non-printing Bootstrap in critical (already via additionalData)
3. **Oct 6, 2025** - Forms component is conditional, not critical (all styles class-scoped)
4. **Oct 6, 2025** - **Wrapper files approach:** Created bootstrap-components/ directory with wrapper SCSS files to resolve partial naming issues
5. **Oct 6, 2025** - Patterns import wrappers using relative paths instead of direct Bootstrap imports

### Important Reminders

- Always run `npm run build` after making changes
- Check webpack output for errors after each step
- Update IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md after every completed task
- Test before moving to next phase
- Keep WP_DEBUG true during implementation
- Document any deviations from the plan
- **URGENT:** Fix webpack splitChunks component extraction before live site testing

## RESOLVED ISSUE: Webpack SplitChunks Not Extracting Components

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Discovered:** Oct 7, 2025
**Resolved:** Oct 8, 2025
**Impact:** High - Conditional loading could not work without separate component files

### Problem
- Webpack was NOT extracting individual Bootstrap component CSS files
- Only `bootstrap-critical.css` was being generated
- Expected files like `bootstrap-card.css`, `bootstrap-modal.css`, etc. were missing
- Bootstrap critical was being imported in both 00-protons/index.js and _all.scss causing duplication

### Root Cause
Bootstrap-critical was being imported in two places:
1. In `00-protons/printing/libs/_all.scss` (as part of the main bundle)
2. Being extracted by splitChunks config

This caused it to be included in both dream.css AND bootstrap-critical.css

### Resolution
1. Removed `@import 'bootstrap-critical'` from `00-protons/printing/libs/_all.scss`
2. Added `import './printing/libs/_bootstrap-critical.scss'` to `00-protons/index.js` BEFORE `_base.scss`
3. Webpack's splitChunks now properly extracts it into a separate file
4. No duplication in dream.css

### Result
- ✅ All 22 Bootstrap component CSS files now generating correctly
- ✅ bootstrap-critical.css (302KB) loads on all pages
- ✅ Individual component files load conditionally
- ✅ No Bootstrap code duplication in dream.css

## Post-Implementation Enhancements

**Date:** Oct 8, 2025

### Enhancement 1: Template-Based Detection
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Added template hierarchy detection to automatically load Bootstrap components based on which WordPress template is being used.

**Implementation:**
- Added `get_template_components()` method to bootstrap-loader.php
- Scans manifest for template → patterns → components chain
- Supports WordPress template hierarchy (is_page, is_singular, is_archive, etc.)
- Fixed conditional ordering bug (is_page must come before is_singular)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/functions/bootstrap-loader.php` (lines 86-90, 156-221)
- `webpack-plugins/BootstrapManifestPlugin.js` (template scanning already in place)

**Impact:** Automatic component loading for template-specific patterns (e.g., card on pages/page.twig)

### Enhancement 2: Widget Area Scanning
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Added scanning of widget areas to detect blocks in sidebars and load their required Bootstrap components.

**Implementation:**
- Added `get_components_from_widgets()` method to bootstrap-loader.php
- Scans all active sidebars for block widgets
- Parses block widget content and detects components
- Integrated into main component detection flow
- Added cache invalidation when widgets change

**Files Modified:**
- `src/functions/bootstrap-loader.php` (lines 145-146, 277-320, 373-380)

**Impact:** Bootstrap components in widget areas now load automatically

### Enhancement 3: Expanded PHP Template Scanning
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Expanded build-time PHP scanning to detect more Timber rendering methods and scan more locations.

**Implementation:**
- Added `Timber::fetch()` to regex pattern matching
- Added scanning of `/src/functions/**/*.php` files
- Already scanning theme root PHP files

**Files Modified:**
- `webpack-plugins/BootstrapManifestPlugin.js` (lines 207-215, 266-288)

**Impact:** More comprehensive template detection, catches Timber usage in custom functions

### Enhancement 4: Cache Improvements
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Enhanced cache invalidation to handle widget changes.

**Implementation:**
- Added `clear_all_post_caches()` method
- Hooks into `update_option_sidebars_widgets` and `update_option_widget_block`
- Clears all post-specific component caches when widgets change

**Files Modified:**
- `src/functions/bootstrap-loader.php` (lines 15-16, 373-380)

**Impact:** Cache automatically invalidates when widget configuration changes

### Enhancement 5: Pattern Block Support
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Added automatic Bootstrap component detection for the pattern block (acf/pattern).

**Implementation:**
- Extended `get_ajax_preload_components()` to handle pattern block
- Reads ACF fields `group`, `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms` from block attributes
- Dynamically determines which pattern is selected and pre-loads its components
- Added documentation note about future dynamic pattern blocks

**Files Modified:**
- `src/functions/bootstrap-loader.php` (lines 251-308)

**Impact:** Pattern block now automatically loads required Bootstrap components just like posts-loop block

**Important Note for Future Development:**
If you add new blocks that dynamically load patterns in the future, you may need to add detection logic to `get_ajax_preload_components()`. Look for blocks that:
- Store pattern selection in ACF fields
- Use `{% include %}` with variables
- Load content via AJAX

---

### Enhancement 6: Bootstrap JavaScript Splitting ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** Oct 9, 2025

Fixed Bootstrap JavaScript to properly load with all dependencies by changing imports from `/dist/` to `/src/`.

**Problem Identified:**
- Bootstrap JS components were importing from `bootstrap/js/dist/` (pre-compiled UMD modules)
- These expect dependencies to be available globally, but webpack wasn't bundling them
- Result: JS loaded but didn't function (no errors in console)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed all Bootstrap JS imports from `bootstrap/js/dist/*` to `bootstrap/js/src/*` across 13 pattern files
- ES6 source files allow webpack to automatically resolve and bundle all dependencies
- Added eslint-disable comments for imports that appear "unused" but are required

**Files Modified:**
- `00-protons/index.js` - Scrollspy
- `01-atoms/alert/index.js` - Alert
- `01-atoms/button/index.js` - Button, Tooltip, Popover
- `01-atoms/collapse/index.js` - Collapse
- `02-molecules/accordion/index.js` - Collapse
- `02-molecules/carousel/index.js` - Carousel
- `02-molecules/dropdown/index.js` - Dropdown
- `02-molecules/modal/index.js` - Modal
- `02-molecules/nav/index.js` - Tab
- `02-molecules/offcanvas/index.js` - Offcanvas
- `02-molecules/tabs/index.js` - Tab
- `02-molecules/toast/index.js` - Toast
- `03-organisms/header/index.js` - Dropdown

**Technical Details:**
- `/src/` files use ES6 imports that webpack can process
- Webpack automatically bundles all dependencies (EventHandler, BaseComponent, util/*, dom/*)
- Tree-shaking removes unused code
- Deduplication across components (shared utilities bundled once)
- Bootstrap events (`shown.bs.collapse`, `hide.bs.modal`, etc.) now fire properly

**Results:**
- ✅ Bootstrap JS components fully functional
- ✅ Smaller bundle sizes (~58% reduction for modal: 5.1KB vs 12KB)
- ✅ All dependencies properly included
- ✅ Bootstrap events firing correctly
- ✅ Verified working with accordion/collapse functionality
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

**Testing:**
- Tested accordion expand/collapse functionality on live page
- Verified Bootstrap Collapse class available in console
- Confirmed Bootstrap events (`shown.bs.collapse`, `hide.bs.collapse`) firing
- All JavaScript functioning as expected
